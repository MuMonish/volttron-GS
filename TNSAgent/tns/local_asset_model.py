    # LocalAssetModel Base Class
    # A local asset model manages and represents a local asset object,
    # meaning that it
    # (1) determines a power schedule across all active time intervals,
    # (2) calculates costs that are needed by system optimization, and
    # (3) models flexibility, if any, that is available from the control of
    # this asset in active time intervals.
    #
    # This base class provides many of the properties and methods that will
    # be needed to manage local assets--generation and demand alike. However,
    # it schedules only the simplest, constant power throughout active time
    # intervals. Subclassing will be required to perform dynamic power
    # scheduling, expecially where scheduling is highly constrained or
    # invokes optimizations. Even then, implementers might need further
    # subclassing to model their unique assets.
    #
    # Available subclasses that inherit from this base class: (This taxonomy
    # is influenced by the thesis (Kok 2013).
    # Inelastic - dynamic scheduling independent of prices
    # Shiftable - schedule a fixed utility over a time range
    # Buffering - schedule power while managing a (thermal) buffer
    # Storage - optimize revenue, less cost
    # Controllable - unconstrained scheduling based on a polynomial
    #  production or utility def
